reimagine is an app designed to simplify the pointless, arduous process of translating strings through multiple languages before returning a result in english. lyrics, prose and poetry often return fantastic, bizarre results.

reimagine does not utilise the google translate API, and for this reason maybe unstable. if results are returned in any language other than english, try entering a shorter string. this issue will not be fixed.

reimagine is intended for entertainment. if you are not entertained then i am sorry: you are not the audience.

have fun,
